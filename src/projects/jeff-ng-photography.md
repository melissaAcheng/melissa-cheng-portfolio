<!-- About the project, what it does -->

### About

When a college friend found out I had started programming, he asked me to make a portfolio website for his photography side business. He only had an Instagram presence at the time and wanted to have further reach through a website.
\
\
I happily agreed and to start the process, I set up a video call where we could discuss the content, design, feature, and overall website flow. Before the meeting, I collected various examples of photography websites and prepared a list of questions to determine website goals.
\
\
Once we had a clear vision and goals, I sketched out a wireframe on Figma so I could easily share the design with my friend and make edits.

\

After my friend approved the wireframe, I proceeded to code up the website. I chose to use GatsbyJS for fast web performance and SEO optimization. In addition, I built the Gatsby site with Gatsby Cloud, an infrastructure platform that allows for real-time deployment. Through Gatsby Cloud, I could easily share site previews and updates with my friend.

### Looking Ahead

My next steps are to utilize the InstagramAPI, so I can pull the most recent Instagram posts from Jeff's Instagram page and display it on the landing page of the website.
