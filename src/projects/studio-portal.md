<!-- About the project, what it does -->

### About

For our individual capstone project during coding bootcamp, I designed and built Studio Portal - a lesson note taking web application for music teachers and their students. Developing the applicationâ€™s features and functions was simple. I chose to use the MERN stack because of its reputation for high-performance and customization. I utilized the YouTube API so teachers can easily search for and include a YouTube in the lesson note.

### Process and Learning

This was one of the first projects I brainstormed and designed on my own from scratch. Surprisingly, I found the planning process to be the most challenging and without a doubt, the most important step. It was also my first time working with one to many relationships in MongoDB. Compared to SQL, querying in MongoDB requires the developer to plan out and decide how the data will be called.
\
\
There are two ways to create a one to many relationship in MongoDB - either by embedding or referencing. With embedding, all data is stored in one collection (as called in MongoDB). This is often used for storing a user's address, since the information will most likely only ever be accessed in relation to the specific user. The second way of creating a relational database is through referencing. This is more similar to the one to many relationships in SQL where the tables are linked together through a foreign key. Since I needed to reference lesson notes via a student and a teacher, I decided to use this second structure of referencing.
\
\
My last issue with building the models was deciding on how many collections to make. I initially created three - student, teacher, and notes. However, as I began coding out the application, I found that the student and teacher models and queries were essentially the same. To avoid repeated code, I created one user collection and added a role field of teacher or student.

### Looking Ahead

For future iterations of this project, I would like to add a daily practice chart for students to fill out. Teachers will be able to log in and view their students' progress.
